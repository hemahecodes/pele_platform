Tutorials
==========================

This section contains step-by-step tutorials to familiarise users with all aspects of running PELE software,
from protein preparation to understanding output files.

We assume you have already installed the software and have access to Schrödinger Maestro.

    - `Disturbing protein-protein interaction between a bromodomain and a histone <ppi.html>`_
    - `Glide docking pose refinement in hemagglutinin binding site <induced_fit.html>`_
    - `GPCR simulation of BU72 agonist of the μ-opioid receptor <gpcr.html>`_
    - `Performing a fragment growing simulation into a p38 kynase <frag_pele.html>`_

All tutorial files are available in ``pele_platform/Examples/tutorials``.

For further information about the outputs obtained, refear `here <outputs.rst>`_
